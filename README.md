# Realtime_moving_graphs  alows your plot moving graphs with time....i found the base code in the google pages..thanks to developer for base code...over the base code i added moving graphs reading the excel data and saving the graph to a video.
1) copy the 2 files "Realtime_graph_final.py" and "test.xlsx" to same folder anywhere in your PC
2) open "Realtime_graph_final.py" in IDLE (python 3.7, i use 3.7)
3) run the file python
4) this python code reads the "test.xlsx" and plots the dynamic graph which scrolls, once the code starts running
please note: you have to read some description lines in the code...comment/uncomment few lines in the code to save the graphs to a video file..:)

thanks to the developer who made the base code....you can make more interesting changes and update here.
